# FakeNewsDetection-using-Python
A machine Learning and data analysis model created and trained using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn and seaborne to detect fake news using supervised and unsupervised machine learning and to do Data analysis. 
Four models were trained on the refined JSON dataset by pre-processing it and splitting it into training and testing datasets, then feature extraction was done by creating a bag-of words with all unique words, removed all the stop words., find top 20 most frequently used words, top 20 from real headlines and fake headlines and plot their respective graphs using count-vectoriser from sklearn. 
A comparative analysis was also done off the respective headlines by creating a box plot.
ML models used are : -LogisticRegression Classifier -Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier -KNN Classifier -Random Forest Classifier
